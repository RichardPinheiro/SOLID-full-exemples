SOLID
=====

Project with PHP examples of the SOLID Principles for better programming quality. The examples were written in PHP,
because itâ€™s the language I work on, but SOLID is related to good programming practices, not being connected
directly to any programming language.


* Why learn SOLID?

Because it is a great practice that will improve the quality of your software:

* Facilitating the understanding of the code.
* Avoiding discrepancy and redundancy.
* Providing more cohesion to the code.
* Improving your code organization.
* Eliminating unnecessary dependencies and couplings.
* Concise standard:
   * Easy understanding.
   * Easy maintenance.
   * Lesser learning curve.
   * Higher productivity.
   * Less cost.

* Shortcuts

* [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](src/GSoares/SOLID/LiskovSubstitution)
* [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](src/GSoares/SOLID/InterfaceSegregation)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](src/GSoares/SOLID/DependencyInversion)
