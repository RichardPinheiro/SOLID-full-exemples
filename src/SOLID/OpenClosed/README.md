Open / Closed Principle (OCP)
=====

The definition of this OCP principle, which means "Open and Closed" states that:
"A class must be open for extension, but closed for change".

To contemplate this principle we use abasations and polyporphism. When extending a new behavior in a
class, we must create new code and not change existing code.
