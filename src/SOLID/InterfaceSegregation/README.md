Segregation Principle Interface (ISP)
=====

The ISP definition, or the principle of interface segregation, states that: "Customers should not be forced to depend
of methods they do not use ", that is, classes should not be required to implement methods they do not use.

* This principle deals with the cohesion of the interfaces.
